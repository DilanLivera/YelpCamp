We investigated the camping locations in the Western part of the Island, and decided that this caravan park would best suit our needs – all the above facilities plus easy and close access to Flinders Chase National Park (just under 10 mins drive away)."

Ethel Beach is stunning, with orange sand and pounding waves.  There is a shipwreck on the beach, but all that remains is some jagged pieces of the boat, and hard to work out what it once was!.   In the right light conditions, photographers will enjoy this beach.</p>"
